var hxLocalOptions = {makeTOC: true};
</script>

<p>This page has a bunch of sample text and image tricks. All of them can be combined with each other. Don't forget to include the HX-JS tags when you use them, but you only need to include them once per page.</p>

<pre style="display:inline-block;"><code class=" language-html">&lt;script src="&#47;static&#47;hx.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="&#47;static&#47;hx.css"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>You probably noticed the table-of-contents hanging on the right there. That's sometimes useful on long pages like this one, and you can use <code class="language-html">&lt;script&gt;var hxLocalOptions = {makeTOC: true};&lt;/script&gt;</code> at the top of your page to make that appear if you want.</p>
