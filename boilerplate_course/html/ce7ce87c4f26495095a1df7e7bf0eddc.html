<h3>Formatting Numbers</h3>

<p>While there is a 5% tolerance for most of the problems in this course, you must also be sure to enter your numbers in the right format. If you type "9.48e5" in the answer box above, the computer knows how to interpret that. Similarly, it knows how to interpret "9.48*10^5" or"9.48 * 10 ^ 5" (with spaces).</p>

<p>What it <i>doesn't</i> know how to do is handle "9.48 x 10 ^ 5" with an "x" instead of a star. That little change throws things off. You need to use <em>exactly</em> the right formatting.</p>

<p>This is one of the most common errors made by people who are new to edX. If you are working on a numerical problem, you should double-check your formatting before entering each answer.</p>

<p>Also - did you look at the answer to the last problem? It contains extra information about partial credit in numerical problems! Go take a look if you didn't see it before.</p>
