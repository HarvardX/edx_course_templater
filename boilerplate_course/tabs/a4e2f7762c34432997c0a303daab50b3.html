<h3>I just enrolled but I see that the course began already. Am I too late?</h3>
<p>New participants are welcome at any time! As long as the course has opened, you can begin once you enroll.</p>

<h3>How do I navigate the course?</h3>
<p>Start with “Course.” Click to open a section. Click on the “Day” or “Section.” Click across icons on the “Ribbon” to go through the material. Complete the work on each page. You
  can adjust video play speed in the video player. You can also turn the captions on and off, and download the transcripts and videos.</p>

<h3>What are the system requirements for this course?</h3>
<p>The course was tested on recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. We’ve found some bugs in assessments that occur on Safari, and do not
  recommend using it. While it is possible to access the course on tablets and other mobile devices, some parts of the course do not function correctly, and it is recommended that you take the course on a laptop or desktop to have full
  functionality.</p>

<h3>How long will I have access to the course materials?</h3>
<p>Audit learners will lose access to the course materials the number of weeks given as the course length. This time is counted from when you enroll or from when the course begins, whichever is later. </p>
<p>Verified learners will have access to most of the course materials, even after the course closes. However, in some cases, content made available with external tools, or content you submit to external tools may not be available more than
  thirty days after the course ends. Where our agreements and the technology allow, we will make downloads of your content available. If there are specific items like links you’ve posted or code you’ve submitted that you wish to retain, we
  recommend you copy and paste to a file you save within the availability window. Please save any important work, especially essays and projects, before the course closes. </p>

<h3>Will the text of the lectures be available?</h3>
<p>Yes, transcripts of the course will be made available alongside each video. You can also download the transcripts as needed.</p>

<h3>Is there a textbook?</h3>
<p>No, there is no textbook for this course.</p>

<h3>What is the format of the class?</h3>
<p>This is a self-paced course. Lessons are a mix of pre-recorded lecture videos, readings, and assessments. Progress at your own pace but try to cover at least one “week” each
  week. Please finish before the course closes. Learners on the audit track will lose free access after the number of weeks given as the course length.</p>

<h3>What are the assessments?</h3>
<p>This course contains graded and ungraded assessments throughout the course to test your understanding of the material and encourage engagement with the course. There are several types of graded assessments; these include multiple choice,
  which will have one correct answer, checkbox questions, which will have two or more correct answers, image-based analysis questions, and short answers. Ungraded assessments include polls and discussion boards, as well as some optional essays.
  We highly encourage all students to complete these assignments, as they offer an opportunity to interact with other students.</p>

<h3>How will I be graded? How do I earn the Certificate?</h3>
<p>Online learners who achieve a passing grade and have upgraded to the verified track can get a certificate. These certificates will indicate that you have
  successfully completed the course, but will not include a specific grade. Certificates will be issued by edX and will have the HarvardX logo and name(s)/signature(s) of the faculty.</p>

<h3>Am I able to upgrade to a certificate after I complete the course?</h3>
<p>Learners are able to upgrade after beginning or completing the course, even if their audit time expires (after they lose audit access) to the course. As long as they attempt to upgrade before the upgrade verification deadline, learners are
  able to upgrade. However, be advised that prices will be updated in the future.</p>

<p>For more information about certificates, please see this <a href="https://support.edx.org/hc/en-us/categories/115002269627-Certificates">certificate
    help page</a>. </p>

<h3>Why is some content "locked"?</h3>
<p>Some content in edX is available only to learners who have purchased a <a href="https://www.edx.org/verified-certificate">verified
    certificate</a>. Locked content is marked with a lock icon. When you see this icon, it indicates there are one or more graded assignments on this page. Verified learners will be able to see and complete these assignments, which
  will count toward their certificate of completion.</p>

<h3>Is financial aid available?</h3>
<p>Yes. For more information on financial assistance, please visit edX's <a href="https://support.edx.org/hc/en-us/articles/215167857-How-do-I-apply-for-financial-assistance-">financial
    assistance page</a>.</p>

<h3>When is work due? Are there deadlines? How can I shift the due dates?</h3>
<p>The project schedule is flexible for participants. Simply work at your own pace to complete the materials. Some due dates can be shifted. For more information, see this <a href="https://support.edx.org/hc/en-us/articles/360049382273-Does-my-course-have-due-dates-">help
    page from edX</a>. </p>

<h3>What do the blue clocks mean?</h3>
<p>All graded material has a blue clock icon next to it. If the item also has a deadline, that date is listed right below.</p>

<h3>How do I see the correct answer?</h3>
<p>For multiple choice and checkbox questions, to submit your answer for points, select ‘Check.’ If you are stumped, you can select ‘show answer,’ but this will result in
  forfeiture of your points. Please note: if you select ‘Show Answer’ before clicking ‘Check,’ you will receive 0 points. Leaving a question black and clicking "Check" will also result in an incorrect attempt. If it is the last attempt and the
  question is left black, clicking "Final Check" with no answer submitted will also result in zero points scored. Once you have a green check mark, no need to do anything else, you got the points!</p>

<h3>Why am I not getting green check marks?</h3>
<p>These green check marks are a new feature on edX. They have been working to make them available for video completion as well as for assessments. However, the check marks
  are “buggy” and do not always appear. Video completion is not graded, so please do not worry if you are missing these green check marks. Please refer to your progress tab and the grading policy of the course to more accurately gauge your
  progress.</p>

<h3>Are there follow-ups to the course?</h3>
<p>At this time, there are no additional courses. However, we recommend participating in any future edX courses you find interesting!</p>
