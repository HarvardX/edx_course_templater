ANANT AGARWAL: Welcome to edX.

1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,480
I&#39;m Anant Agarwal, I&#39;m the president of edX,

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,430
I&#39;m also a professor of electrical engineering and computer science

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,400
at MIT.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,120
Online learning is revolutionizing the world.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,290
Education will never be the same again, and edX

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,650
is at the cutting edge of this revolution,

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,790
so when you take edX courses online, you are part of this evolution.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,550
Online learning is the ultimate democratizer.

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,190
When you learn on edX, you&#39;re joining a community.

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,470
Imagine taking a class with 100,000 or more students-- this social,

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,467
this is a lot of fun.

00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:34,050
I think you will enjoy the experience.

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,400
At edX it&#39;s about people, it&#39;s not about profit.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,060
For you, edX is about the best courses from the best schools and the best

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:42,910
professors.

16
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,649
Becoming a member of edX is easy.

17
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:47,690
SPEAKER 2: We&#39;re really excited to have you here.

00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,990
choose, and have some fun.

20
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,510
Registration takes seconds, and once you register just browse the courses.

21
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,870
When you find something that you like, click it.

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,860
It&#39;s that easy.

23
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,150
Choose wisely, you&#39;re selecting courses from the best schools

24
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,570
all around the world.

25
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,570
Make sure to check the prerequisites.

26
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,506
Now you can choose your course and you&#39;re on your way.

27
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:12,509
Welcome to the club.

28
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:15,550
SPEAKER 3: Now that you&#39;ve signed up for course, you can view courseware.

29
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,680
The courseware is made up of great videos, automated feedback,

30
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,030
and cool interactive features, all for self-paced learning.

31
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,080
The interactives are designed to help you

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,630
explore your understanding of key concepts.

33
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,786
A big part of edX is getting instant feedback on your answers,

34
00:01:29,786 --> 00:01:31,660
frequently in the form of a green check mark.

35
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,659
In a lot of questions, you can try as many times

36
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,570
as you need to get that right answer.

37
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,490
Courses can be tough, we make sure that they&#39;re rigorous,

38
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,235
but they can also be a lot of fun.

39
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:42,970
A big part of edX is the social aspect.

40
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,660
You can be a social as you want on the discussion boards.

41
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,940
In our forums, there&#39;s an active community.

42
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,790
It&#39;s not just the professors, students help each other out.

43
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,902
A typical course can run a semester length, or about 12 weeks.

44
00:01:53,902 --> 00:01:56,610
At the end of that course, if you&#39;ve met the course requirements,

45
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,310
you can get a certificate of mastery.

46
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,920
Once you&#39;ve completed the course, you&#39;re part of our group of lifelong learners.

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,300
