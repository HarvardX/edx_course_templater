00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,792
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: Welcome to the final office hours for ChinaX.

1
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:10,020
I'm Peter Bol, and I'm here with Ted Hui who's been with you the whole semester.

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,830
And this time, we were fortunate to bring all our faculty together

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,040
who have been teaching in this course to have a group discussion.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,110
We also asked you to let us know what pieces you particularly liked

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:28,800
and send in your final assessments to share them on the forum, if you chose.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,810
The forum ran into some technical problems this past week,

7
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,510
and Ted, you have an update on that?

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,468
MING TAK TED HUI: Yeah.

9
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:37,380
I want to apologize for the problem in the discussion forum--

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,370
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: It's not your fault.

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:38,700
MING TAK TED HUI: Oh.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,140
I mean, there were some technical issues last week.

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,280
So the width of the screen is a little bit off-centered

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,430
and the edX engineers are now trying to fix the problem.

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,530
They will give us an update as soon as possible.

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,140
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: OK.

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,640
Good.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,390
I've been really struck by the sorts of comments students have made

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,870
and the depth of learning and intelligence that they have had.

20
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,660
Jenny Howsam, who's been very active on the Facebook group this year,

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,330
has gotten people to talk a little about the sorts of things,

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,622
if there were favorites, right?

23
00:01:09,622 --> 00:01:10,663
MING TAK TED HUI: Indeed.

24
00:01:10,663 --> 00:01:13,230
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: And of course, Michael Puett is always

25
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,750
a favorite when it comes to lecturing.

26
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,170
For some, the poetry of Tao Yuanming came up again and again.

27
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,402
MING TAK TED HUI: Sure.

28
00:01:22,402 --> 00:01:24,360
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: "Story of the Stone" also.

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,734
This is really in the humanities.

30
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:27,810
But I'd say Tao Yuanming, "Story of the Stone,"

31
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,550
these were things that resonated with a lot of people.

32
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,950
And also, I think there was a real appreciation for some work

33
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,920
that Eugene Wang, Professor Wang did on Chinese painting.

34
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:48,060
Now we also encouraged you to share your final assessment on the discussion

35
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,720
forum, and some people did.

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,630
Not as many of you have could, but the discussion board at the moment

37
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,260
isn't working very well, so that needs to be repaired.

38
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,500
But we've been really, really impressed by the things you've written,

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,620
and we're very glad that you have shared them.

40
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,450
There were some suggestions, for example,

41
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,479
that we ought to have a roundtable discussion in the beginning.

42
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,340
In fact, the faculty met together and had

43
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,100
an extensive discussion about what we were doing and why,

44
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,950
and sort of hammering out our different goals and trying to put them together.

45
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,180
But we didn't tape that one, the initial meeting.

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,930
MING TAK TED HUI: You should have.

47
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,020
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: Perhaps in the future-- we should have, right.

48
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,700
People always have asked for more, I think, than we've been able to do.

49
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,380
Should we be giving the whole development of Chinese poetry,

50
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,260
for example, through the lyric poetry?

51
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,760
The Song, Tang and Song.

52
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,470
How about the late Ming xiao shuo, the short stories,

53
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,087
and the long form stories, the novels?

54
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:53,670
They're there.

55
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,750
There's lots translated.

56
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,560
People should read them.

57
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,518
MING TAK TED HUI: Yeah.

58
00:02:56,518 --> 00:02:59,160
And I mean, I got some suggestions about having a course on,

59
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,290
like, philosophy and religion that actually

60
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,530
serve as the base of those writings that we have.

61
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,710
And I mean, being familiar with the classical text might helped

62
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,870
to understand a lot of the problems we have

63
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,946
or the issues we encounter in the course, of the course.

64
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:17,820
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: Maybe we could say a few things about the things

65
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,500
people have shared on the forum.

66
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,980
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring it up,

67
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,540
and I'm going to ask Ted Hui, who's been following things very, very closely,

68
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,975
whether he agrees with what people wrote.

69
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:36,210
And to begin with, David Doubleday commented on a piece,

70
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,500
a Tao Yuanming poem called "The Sixth Month--" this is for the year 408,

71
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,320
although Tao Yuanming didn't know it was 408--

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,820
"we had a fire."

73
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,380
So what's this about, and what do you think of David's comments?

74
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,380
MING TAK TED HUI: I think it's very interesting,

75
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,850
because this is a poem that comes up in Professor Tian's module.

76
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,240
And I think it's interesting in a sense, because he actually brings up--

77
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,710
I mean, he does a lot of comparison between Tao Yuanming and other writers

78
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,810
like a 17th century Anglo-American poet who wrote a lyric on the same topic

79
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,640
on encountering a fire.

80
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,820
A lot of the moves and a lot of techniques on that poem

81
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,930
is also very similar to what Tao Yuanming had done.

82
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,610
So it's very interesting to make that comparison.

83
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,470
And I think the point he's trying to make

84
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,750
is that how individual faces challenges or adversity, and how that, I mean,

85
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,510
helps us to think about what an individual is

86
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,190
when they're faced with difficulty.

87
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,290
And I think a lot of his comments, I mean, to think about what--

88
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,325
I mean, is there a shared humanity between people?

89
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:41,970
I mean, when they are at times of difficulty or adversity?

90
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,900
I mean, that itself is a very interesting take, and I would--

91
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,080
I mean, there are a lot of interesting things

92
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,340
that he mentioned, especially about facing an adversity

93
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,742
and trying to write about it.

94
00:04:54,742 --> 00:04:57,450
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: I'd like to come back, though, to this point

95
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:02,270
that I think-- it struck me as I read through these postings

96
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:08,030
that one of the things that I'm happiest about this course

97
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:13,010
is that we moved the discussion away from Chinese culture

98
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,410
or Chinese cultural identity to a shared human identity.

99
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:24,750
And that when we get down to the actual work in literature,

100
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:31,750
in philosophy, whatever, we actually start to read them as human beings,

101
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,250
and that's how they come across.

102
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,850
There's another famous piece by Tao Yuanming, which I remember I had to--

103
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,270
one of the first pieces we had to learn how to read in, I think,

104
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,335
second-year Literary chinese was called "The Peach Blossom Spring"

105
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:45,280
by Tao Yuanming.

106
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,630
This is the story where he goes into this paradise and spends time there.

107
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:57,350
Then comes out and it's centuries later, and he can't find his way back.

108
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,375
And Amelia Renaud writes about this as well.

109
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,500
MING TAK TED HUI: I think--

110
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,240
I mean, it's a very interesting take on the story of "The Peach Blossom

111
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,740
Spring."

112
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,030
And I think-- I mean, a lot of the observations are very--

113
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,660
I mean, are incredible.

114
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,420
I mean, the story suggests that people are naturally good in some ways,

115
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,950
and that when they grow up even in society rituals like hierarchy

116
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:26,320
are not taken very seriously in that piece, but it's like an ideal utopia

117
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,140
that they're trying to portray.

118
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,160
I think one interesting take there that I have doubts is that,

119
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:40,190
is this an anti-Confucian society, or is this a Confucian society

120
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,490
that Tao Yuanming is portraying?

121
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,540
Because I think it's a little bit hard for me to tell in some sense,

122
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,554
because we do have a utopian vision also in the Confucian--

123
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:51,762
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: Oh, yes.

124
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:53,989
Is it a society with family?

125
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:55,030
MING TAK TED HUI: Mm-hmm.

126
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,840
Yes, indeed.

127
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: OK.

128
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,810
Is it a society where there's a division of labor of some kind?

129
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,860
MING TAK TED HUI: Yeah.

130
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,044
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: Is it a society where there's some sense of hierarchy?

131
00:07:04,044 --> 00:07:04,960
MING TAK TED HUI: Yes.

132
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,516
So there is--

133
00:07:05,516 --> 00:07:08,390
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: It sounds to me like it's Confucian, doesn't it?

134
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,348
MING TAK TED HUI: Yeah.

135
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:13,510
So it's very interesting in a sense, because I mean, you do see families.

136
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,630
You do see, like, division of labors.

137
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,190
The problem is that--

138
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:23,260
I mean, so that's why when we envision a society, a utopian

139
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,310
society, how much of that is--

140
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:32,260
how much of that presents a society that is Confucian, and how much of that

141
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:32,770
is not?

142
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,810
I mean, is this a valid question, or is it--

143
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,872
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: Well, so maybe it is--

144
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:41,330
well, I think there are two things.

145
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,050
One is whether you label it Confucian or not may not be the issue.

146
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,590
But what is the notion of utopia?

147
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,380
And clearly, there is a notion of a utopia,

148
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,010
of an ideal world in China where everyone has a place.

149
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,550
Everyone has a role.

150
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,590
There's not conflict.

151
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,840
There's not division.

152
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,640
But there's also a view that says, well, you know--

153
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,050
and we find this among some of the Daoist writings

154
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,350
that an ideal society is one where family is irrelevant, where government

155
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,910
is irrelevant, and things like that.

156
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,010
And that doesn't seem to be Tao's view.

157
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,140
MING TAK TED HUI: Yep.

158
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,264
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: Right.

159
00:08:16,264 --> 00:08:18,949
But it's also a society which is lost.

160
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:19,990
MING TAK TED HUI: Indeed.

161
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,610
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: We can't find it back.

162
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,760
MING TAK TED HUI: We can't find it back.

163
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,640
Exactly.

164
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,800
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: Yeah.

165
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,900
We want to believe in it.

166
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,276
It's our best dream.

167
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:27,192
MING TAK TED HUI: Yes.

168
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:31,630
So that's why I think it's very interesting in a sense that, I mean,

169
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,630
we think of "The Peach Blossom Spring" as a place

170
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:42,010
that is out of the empire, that escaped from the hierarchical structure that

171
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,250
is already at that moment in Tao Yuanming's time.

172
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,400
But on the other hand, I mean, when he envisioned a society, a utopian

173
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,600
society, there are family structures, there are still hierarchical structures

174
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,280
that he would want to remain.

175
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,360
So it's very interesting.

176
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,720
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: Right.

177
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,780
Right.

178
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:04,540
Everboleh talked about the painting by Zhu Da, right?

179
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,480
The 17th century painter called the "Fish and Fish Hawk."

180
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,860
So it was a painting with a fish hawk looking down at that fish

181
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,340
that he's about to eat.

182
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,850
What's that painting about?

183
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,260
MING TAK TED HUI: So I think everboleh used an autobiographical reading

184
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:27,190
and tried to look at the painting about that moment of eating and preying

185
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,544
itself resembles the moment when Zhu Da is actually being preyed by the Qing.

186
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:34,460
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: Preyed upon by that Qing.

187
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,710
MING TAK TED HUI: By the Qing.

188
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:40,180
And it's very interesting reading, because I think it actually--

189
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,070
I mean, trying to contextualize that painting

190
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,820
and trying to locate the individual voice within the painting, which

191
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,440
I think Professor Eugene Wang would appreciate a lot.

192
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,100
I mean, because it's one of the interesting aspects of those paintings.

193
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,150
I mean, if you read it with the biography of the painter,

194
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,697
then you can actually see something deeper within it.

195
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:01,780
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: Yeah.

196
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,410
So that, I think, gets an interesting issue with--

197
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:11,044
there's a general view, that Chinese poetry tends to be--

198
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,460
MING TAK TED HUI: Autobiographical

199
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,810
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: Autobiographical.

200
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,101
The question in my mind has always been, to what extent

201
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:18,160
can that be true for paintings too?

202
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,130
But clearly, for some paintings, they are.

203
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,290
And it does strike me that this set of paintings we see in the 17th century,

204
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:31,030
not only by Zhu Da but a number of other painters

205
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,500
are intensely autobiographical, or commentaries on the world

206
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,530
that they're facing.

207
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:36,960
MING TAK TED HUI: Indeed.

208
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,460
Indeed.

209
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,100
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: A poem is a poet responding to a world

210
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,670
that they're depicting, they're telling you about, that they're seeing.

211
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:52,180
And paintings tell you about that world they choose to see as well.

212
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:58,180
Now Jenny had a particular liking for one of the plays

213
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:05,980
by Xu Wei called "The Female Mulan Joins the Army in Place

214
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,731
of her Father" from a play series called the "Four Cries of a Gibbon"

215
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:12,230
by Sisheng.

216
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,110
Way

217
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,990
This was not something that was assigned,

218
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,150
but she has been reading herself.

219
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,610
She reads a book by Shiamin Kwa about it.

220
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,640
And Shiamin Kwa was one of our students here at Harvard, so glad

221
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,880
that she stayed in the school, so to speak.

222
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,630
What do you think of her comments on this?

223
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,588
MING TAK TED HUI: Her comments are fascinating,

224
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:33,310
because it's about identity and identity construction.

225
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,350
I mean, especially when you have, like--

226
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,340
I mean, because the story of Mulan is a very famous story,

227
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,260
because you have the Disney adaptation later in the animation version.

228
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,560
So I mean, a lot about cross-dressing.

229
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,440
Like, when a female was--

230
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:58,090
I mean, trying to replace her father to join into the army.

231
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,240
So there's a lot about identity and role playing.

232
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,150
But that itself is more complicated when it comes to a play,

233
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,170
because you have to--

234
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,960
I mean, there's an actor who has to play that role.

235
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,450
So they're, like, double cross-dressing within it.

236
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,380
So there are a lot about identity construction within that play,

237
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,840
and I think Jenny actually aptly pointed it out.

238
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,070
And I think it's really interesting in that sense.

239
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:19,410
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: Good.

240
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,740
We should let Shiamin Kwa know.

241
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,698
MING TAK TED HUI: Yeah.

242
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:23,420
I mean, her translation is really great.

243
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,960
So it's a very enjoyable read.

244
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,480
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: And also she notes Wu Weiye's "A Lament for my Daughter"

245
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,550
as another thing.

246
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:37,990
Now another popular piece was the Ne-zha's story

247
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,600
that Professor Tian brings up, right?

248
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,390
And David Doubleday also writes about that.

249
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,630
And everboleh also writes about the story of Ne-zha.

250
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,462
What do you think?

251
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:55,420
MING TAK TED HUI: I think both of them actually

252
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,920
pointed out about the power structure or the hierarchy

253
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,150
within "Feng Shen Ji," within the Ne-zha section of "Feng Shen Ji."

254
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,160
And I think it's really interesting, because I

255
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,620
mean, a lot of the questions actually come

256
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,600
from how we think about a family that is a little bit dysfunctional.

257
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,440
I mean, when your father doesn't really love the son.

258
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,460
And I mean, how does that work when you have also another problem when

259
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,920
you are pushed with a lot of--

260
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,260
you have a more-- a broader worldview, like a Daoist, immortal worldview.

261
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,930
I mean, Ne-zha in that hierarchy sounds to be

262
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,020
a little bit superior than his father.

263
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,640
Then how do we deal with it?

264
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,460
And I think a lot of the questions and a lot of the ideas

265
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,670
that they have actually pointed to this question.

266
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,170
When you have conflicts in hierarchies, conflicts in values,

267
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,960
I mean, how do we think about it in terms of--

268
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,400
I mean, in this novel?

269
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,670
And I think it's interesting, because it remains as a question.

270
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,530
I mean, the power of Ne-zha.

271
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:02,590
Which, a lot of us actually enjoyed the story because there's a destructive

272
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:08,920
energy or a life energy within Ne-zha, which doesn't sound to us more--

273
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,490
I mean, confined to the Confucian family values sometimes,

274
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,320
because it's quite destructive too.

275
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,390
So how to think about that.

276
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:21,580
I mean, it's the common theme that I think both these essays pointed out,

277
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,795
and I think it's very interesting.

278
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:24,980
PROFESSOR PETER BOL: Good.

279
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,080
I think that at the heart of the humanities

280
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,460
is this engagement with the works of the past.

281
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,170
And one of the things about them is that this is--

282
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:40,360
you know, in history we distill lots of information

283
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:47,290
to try to explain how the world changed and why people made those choices that

284
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,700
changed things in that direction.

285
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,120
But I think in the humanities, and I think

286
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,090
this course has been a wonderful example of that--

287
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,930
we need to give people the opportunity to read

288
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,820
the world as people saw it in their own words

289
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,730
at the time, translated though it is.

290
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,052
But you know, even when we say, OK.

291
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:08,010
But here is a painting.

292
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,030
It's the original, right?

293
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:14,170
It's still-- we still have to translate it in some way.

294
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,280
We still have to be able to look and figure out,

295
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,540
what was the significance of this at the time to those people?

296
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,220
And so translation is another layer of interpretation.

297
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,470
But the essays you've written, the comments you've made

298
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,600
are also about your interpretations.

299
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,370
And sharing that has been tremendously valuable for us and inspiring as well.

300
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,570
And on behalf of all the faculty involved,

301
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,460
I want to express our thanks to you for being participants in this.

302
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:53,560
As teachers, ultimately, it's having engaged

303
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,260
students who care about the subject.

304
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,930
It makes all the difference.

305
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:04,210
Now I was asked a question about--

306
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:10,800
particularly since I'm going to have a bit more free time now,

307
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,350
if we're going to be doing more with these MOOCs on China.

308
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,380
You know, Harvard's been very generous to us

309
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:23,020
in allowing us to do a lot on China, but also, we've

310
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,500
had faculty who wanted to do it, who wanted to reach out to you.

311
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,277
So we actually do have another China course coming up,

312
00:16:31,277 --> 00:16:32,860
but it's going to be rather different.

313
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,720
It's going to be my colleague Bill Kirby, with whom I taught ChinaX

314
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,600
originally.

315
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,180
I will be doing something called Doing Business

316
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:47,530
in China, which we hope to see launch probably in the fall of next year.

317
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,080
Maybe the summer or late spring.

318
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,730
And then we're going to actually have a set

319
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,000
of courses on the digital humanities, which

320
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,880
is for a professional certificate.

321
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,500
And this really is a very different thing from this kind of humanities,

322
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,740
but it is really about ways in which we can

323
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:15,579
take into account lots of information, and also represent things and visualize

324
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:20,515
things through maps, through network analysis, and so on in new ways.

325
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:23,410
But we hope some of you will eventually be with us for that

326
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,369
as well, although it won't be China-specific.

327
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,970
It will be certainly something I spend my time in.

328
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:35,680
So let us, on behalf of Ted, myself, of the faculty, Meghan Morrissey who's

329
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,860
been sort of behind the scenes, guiding this course,

330
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,740
let me thank you all for joining us.

331
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,740
And we look forward to hearing more from you through Facebook

332
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,700
or through later courses on HarvardX.
