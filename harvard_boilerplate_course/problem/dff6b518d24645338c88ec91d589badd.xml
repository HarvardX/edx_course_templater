  <p>This is a matching exercise. Drag the elements on the left into the ones on the right to create a match. Click on the <span style="color:darkblue">[-]</span> to remove the match. You can match items with more than one other item, but you should choose the best match if you can. Click on the individual items for a better view if you need it.</p>
  <p>This problem type gives partial credit! Each correct assignment is worth one point; each error takes a point away. Play around with different matches to see how it works.</p>

      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Zebras are herbivores, lions are carnivores, and bears are omnivores. Setting "bear" as both "carnivore" and "herbivore" won't work, because those are exclusive categories - they say "only" or "exclusively."</p>
