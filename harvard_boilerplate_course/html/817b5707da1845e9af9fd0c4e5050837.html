<h3 class="hx-underline">Pop-Up Questions</h3>

<p>You can duplicate the <em>top component on this page</em> and place it above any video to make it a pop-up video. You will need to edit that component to adjust the &lt;script&gt; tag. When you're done the "title" entries should match the titles of your problems, and the "time" entries should match when you want them to show up. Hx-js will do the rest!</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As with all javascript, formatting is important. The <em>last item in the timer list</em> does not end with a comma, but the rest of them do. You also need to match the <em>exact</em> title of your problem.</li>
  <li>You can enter the time in seconds or mm:ss format. Decimals are ok.</li>
  <li>It is recommended you don't use this more than every 30 seconds, preferably longer. You should also ask short questions.</li>
  <li>Remember that your learners can always turn off or skip the problems, and they'll still be able to answer them later because they're farther down on the page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below you see the problems. You can use basically any problem type, including polls!</p>
