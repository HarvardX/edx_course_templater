<h3 class="hx-underline">Doing edX Homework</h3>

<p>If you have never before answered problems on edX before, you should go through this segment. It will teach you how to answer numerical questions, use exponential notation, and receive partial credit. The pre-course survey (coming up next) will have plenty of questions for you, so take the time now to make sure you're comfortable answering questions on this platform.</p>

<p>If you have already taken a science, engineering, or mathematics course on edX before, or if you went all the way through <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/demox-edx-demox-1-0" target="_blank">DemoX</a>, you can probably skip this section. You may want to look through to learn about questions that offer partial credit options and how they work, but you don't need to. This section is ungraded.</p>
