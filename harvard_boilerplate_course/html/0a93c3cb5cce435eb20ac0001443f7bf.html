<h3>Welcome to edX!</h3>

<p>Whether you're new to edX, or looking for a refresher on how to use it, welcome!</p>

<p>If this if your first edX class, we strongly recommend you take a short course to get oriented. It's called <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/demox-edx-demox-1-0" target="_blank">DemoX</a>. You can enroll in it just like you did with this course. It should take less than half an hour.</p>

<p>Then, move to the next page, where we'll teach you how to do edX homework problems.</p>
