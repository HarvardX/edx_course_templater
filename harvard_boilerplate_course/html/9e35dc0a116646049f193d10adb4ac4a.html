<h3 class="hx-underline">Final Notes</h3>
<p>This covers the majority of the problems you will see in this course. Keep these final notes in mind as you work out the answers to our questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be sure to check your formatting when you enter numerical responses. Don't get frustrated; computers can be picky.</li>
<li>Sometimes our problems are randomized so that each student sees a slightly different problem. You may see different numbers, text, or even images, from what other students see. You may see problems in different orders, or in different locations.</li>
<li>When asking for help on the discussion forum, don't say things like "I answered D and it was wrong! Why?" because that gives away an answer. You shouldn't give away even wrong answers.</li>
<li>Don't be afraid to use the <a href="">(insert link to discussion forum)</a>. We are all here to support one another!</li>
</ol>
