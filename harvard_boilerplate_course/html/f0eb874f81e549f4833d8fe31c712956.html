<script src="/static/hx.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/hx.css" />

var hxLocalOptions = {makeTOC: true};
</script>

<p>This page has a bunch of sample text and image tricks. All of them can be combined with each other. Don't forget to include the HX-JS tags when you use them, but you only need to include them once per page.</p>

<pre><code class=" language-html">&lt;script src=&quot;/static/hx.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;/static/hx.css&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>

<p>You probably noticed the table-of-contents hanging on the right there. That's sometimes useful on long pages like this one, and you can use <code class="language-html">&lt;script&gt;var hxLocalOptions = {makeTOC: true};&lt;/script&gt;</code> at the top of your page to make that appear if you want.</p>
