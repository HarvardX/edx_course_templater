<p>This next problem has a lot more features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It does rich text instead of plain text.</li>
  <li>It saves learner data so they can see their work elsewhere in the course. Use the <code>data-saveslot</code> attribute to set the default file name.</li>
  <li>It can pull saved work from a previous file. Use the <code>data-from-slot</code> attribute to set that.</li>
  <li>Learners can make multiple files, save them, rename them, and delete them.</li>
  <li>It can export files for the learners to save, in HTML format.</li>
</ul>

<p>Setup is slightly more complex, but not by a ton.
<ul>
  <li><strong>It needs HX-JS on the page in order to work.</strong></li>
  <li>It also needs the Learner Backpack to be in place, which it is in this course.</li>
  <li>You need both an HTML component with the editor, and the advanced problem beneath it for grading. You can't put the editor inside the problem, for reasons I do not yet understand.</li>
  <li>Whatever you name the saveslot for the editor needs to match the "&saveslot=whatever" in the problem's html_file attribute.</li>
</ul>
