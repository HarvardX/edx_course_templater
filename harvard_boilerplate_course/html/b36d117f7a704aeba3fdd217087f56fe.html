<h3 class="hx-underline">Tips for Formula Input</h3>

<p>You may have noticed some unexpected behavior in Math Expression problems. The system we use is very reliable, but like any system it has its quirks. Here are a few things to watch out for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You <strong>must</strong> use explicit multiplication, with as asterisk (*) as the multiplication symbol. For instance, for "a&nbsp;times&nbsp;b" you cannot write "ab" or "axb". You must write "a*b". </li>
  
  <li>Sometimes these problems are <strong>case-sensitive</strong>. For instance, if the answer is "D*E*f", you cannot type "D*E*F", or you will get an error that says "Invalid input: F not permitted in answer."</li>

  <li>That same error appears any time you use a variable that is not allowed in the answer. In some problems, it will be possible to simplify the answer so that the variable you used does not appear in the answer. Other times, you may have typed the wrong letter by mistake.</li>

  <li>Squares of trigonometric expressions are typically written by hand as \(\sin^2(x)\). However, this system requires very specific notation. Writing "(sin(x))^2" will get you the right answer, as will "sin(x)^2". </li>

  <li>Greek letters like \(\theta\) and \(\alpha\) must be written in English. (If you are using a Greek keyboard, pressing the \(\theta\) key will not work for this.) If you are uncertain of how to spell a particular Greek letter in English, Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet#Letters" target="_blank">list of greek letters</a> that you can use for reference. </li>
