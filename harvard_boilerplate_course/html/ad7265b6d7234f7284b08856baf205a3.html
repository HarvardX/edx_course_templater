<p>Some content in edX is available only to learners who have purchased a <a href="https://www.edx.org/verified-certificate" target="_blank">verified certificate</a>. Locked content is marked with a lock icon, as shown to the right. Click the image to see a full-sized version. If you are using screen reader software, you will hear "Content available only to verified-track learners."</p>

<p>When you see this icon, it indicates there are one or more graded assignments on this page. Verified learners will be able to see and complete these assignments, which will count toward their certificate of completion.</p>

<p>In addition, audit learners will lose access to the course after a certain number of weeks. The length of time varies by course, and is noted on the course signup page at <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX.org</a>. This time is counted from when you enroll or from when the course begins, whichever is later. Verified learners retain course access indefinitely.</p>
