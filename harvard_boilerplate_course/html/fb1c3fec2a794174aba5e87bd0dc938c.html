<p>If you've clicked into this section, we're assuming that you are either new to edX, or looking for a refresher on how to use it. Welcome!</p>

<p>First, we strongly recommend you take a short course to get you oriented called <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/demox-edx-demox-1-0">DemoX</a>. Just enroll in it like you did with this course and follow along; it should take less than half an hour.</p>

<p>Then, click on the next button on the tab strip at the top of this page, or use the right-arrow below to move to the next page, where we'll teach you how to do edX homework problems.</p>
