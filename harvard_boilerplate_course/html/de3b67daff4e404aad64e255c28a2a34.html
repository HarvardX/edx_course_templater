<h3 class="hx-underline">The Basics</h3>

<p>All problems in this course are worth a certain number of <strong>points</strong>. You can see this at the top of each question. Once you attempt the question, it will also show how many points you have earned.</p>

<p><strong>Use the "Submit" button to submit your answer.</strong> Most problems have a <strong>limited number of attempts</strong>. A simple true-false problem will only have one attempt allowed. Harder problems may allow up to 10 attempts.</p>

<p>Some problems have <strong>Hints</strong> that will try to help you understand the concept and answer the question. You are not penalized when you ask for a hint. Not all problems have hints. Once the due date has passed, you will be able to see the <strong>complete solutions</strong> to the problems.</p>

<p>Some problems, especially check-all-that-apply questions, may allow for <strong>partial credit</strong>. You can still get points even if you don't answer completely correctly. <strong>You will see a green asterisk</strong> when you get partial credit, regardless of how many points you receive, so make sure to pay attention to the score at the top of the problem. Not all problems give partial credit.</p>

<p>The problems in this section are just for practice. They are worth zero points, and allow an unlimited number of attempts. In other sections of the course you will see point values listed on each problem, along with a number of attempts.</p>
